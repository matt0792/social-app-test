# Venue/Event social app (Currently unnamed)

This is a proof of concept for a venue/event social app that allows users to find, filter, and organize venues according to tags. 
Gone are the days of endlessly scrolling through Instagram to discover what is going on. This app aims to centralize events into a feed to allow for easy discovery and promotion. 
Follow your favorite venues, track the best dj's, save events to your calendar, and share with your friends!
